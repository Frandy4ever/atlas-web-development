## Project Overview
Code~Breeders is an online learning platform focused on delivering quality educational content in an accessible and fun way.
The website is being designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, offering a range of courses,
pricing options, and insightful tutorials from professionals.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website will be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices.
- **Engaging Layout:** Sections like courses, pricing, and professionals' introductions offer an interactive user interface.
- **Multimedia Integration:** Integration of images, videos, and quotes adds to the dynamic nature of the website.

## HTML Structure
The HTML file is structured with semantic elements, including:
- ### `<header>`: The header contains a navigation bar (`navbar`) with links to various sections, including "Courses,"
- "Pricing," and "Login." The logo is represented by an image, and the entire header is wrapped in a header-container div.
- ### `<main>`: The main content of the website is divided into sections like hero, quote, video, membership, and FAQ.

- #### Hero Section
The hero section introduces the site as "under construction." It includes a heading, a paragraph with animated words, and a
"Register for Free" button. Additionally, there are sections for learning from professionals (info and pros).

- #### Quote Section
This section features a quote with an accompanying image, presented within a quote container.
Details about the person providing the quote, including name and title, are also included.

- #### Video Section
The video section showcases popular tutorials with a heading and a set of video cards.
Each card includes the author's name, information about the tutorial, and a section for ratings, with a placeholder for rater information.

- #### Membership Section
The membership section highlights different membership options, each represented by an image, name,
and information. A "Register for Free" button is included at the end.

- #### FAQ Section
The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section includes questions and answers presented in a structured format. Each question is followed by a detailed answer.

- ### `<footer>`: The footer contains a navigation bar (`footer-bar`) with links and social media icons. Copyright information is included at the bottom.

## CSS Styles
A separate `styles.css` file will be linked for styling. The CSS file will contain styles for layout, typography, color schemes, and responsive design adjustments.

## JavaScript
A separate `main.js` file will be linked to add more dynamic interactivity to the website.
This will help make the site more user-friendly and intuitive.

## Images and Multimedia
Placeholder images are currently used with an `alt` attribute indicating future content.
These will be replaced with relevant images and multimedia elements as the site progresses towards completion.
